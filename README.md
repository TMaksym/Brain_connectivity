# Brain_connectivity
Course in Human Neuroscience

From this course, I expect to learn the practical steps of graph theory application for functional connectivity (I've mainly used data-driven methods). Another aspect is related to the data preprocessing, as far as there are some controversies related to this step.  I also expect, that there will be an emphasis on FC disadvantages and its interralation with structural connectivity.
